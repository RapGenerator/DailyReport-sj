- discussed with YiWeiwen about the paper ["Chinese Poetry Generation with Planning based Neural Network"](https://github.com/RapGenerator/WangShijun/blob/master/NotesforChinesePoetryGenerationwithPlanningbasedNeuralNetwork.md), exchanged many ideas
- together, came up with several specific questions, which may influence our next step when implementing our ideas (some of them are solved and not longer questions, listed below)
- add more detials and insights of mine in [our goals & my ideas](https://github.com/RapGenerator/WangShijun/blob/master/Goals%20for%20Algorithm-group%20%26%20My%20Ideas.md)
- gave a talk about the paper and ideas of YiWeiwen and me to the whole group
- discussed with LuYiyang and ShiHua, asked them to preview the [material](https://github.com/RapGenerator/WangShijun/blob/master/data_split_by_rhyme/phonetics_initial%20final%20sound.pdf) about rhyming before tomorrow's coding work

qustions of YiWeiwen & me after discussion in the morning:

- **help wanted** why the generated line contains the keyword used to generate it? how did the modified RNN model do that?
    - need to go through the paper again with aim to implement it
    - need to be done in the coding step
- **solved** where to crawl the data when doing the knowledge-based keywords expansion?
    - solutions now: Wikipedia, Baidubaike, labels of relavant questions on Zhihu
- **solved** does "evaluation metric" refer to "training loss function" or "evaluating after generation"?
    - the latter one
- **solved** is BLEU score able to conbine with traditional loss function? will that work?
    - no and no need to do it
    - human judging is enough
