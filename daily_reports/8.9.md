- discussed with PangYunsheng, got an idea to do rhyming by reversing the generating process to choose the lyrics with the rhyme we want
- discussed with ShiHua and LuYiyang, help them writing code to get the statistics of rhyme
- analyze the statistics og rhyme, change the rhyme judging rules
- rerun the code Shihua wrote yesterday to get the data based on rhyme using the changed rules
- discussed with our teacher and summarize 5 modules needed to be done:
    - deal with dataset based on rhyme, sort out by “排韵”，“隔行韵”，“交韵”，“抱韵”
    - use ranking function in the beam-search step, with reversing the generating process
    - use ranking function after the generation, choose the rhyme lyrics forcingly
    - design a template for rhyme, select some beats for lyrics, determine the rhyme and length for each line (judging the length of lyrics in the beam-search process)
    - start to do front-end development and interaction design soon
        - high-light the rhyme, show the rhyme number, them them attractive
        - add more interaction elements, like "lyrics writing helper"
