- discussed with SunMengxin and MiYuting about front-end functional and UI design
- constructed a model to give a paragraph (4 continuous lines) of lyrics a corresponding score (explanation is as follows)
- completed coding [ranking function](https://github.com/RapGenerator/WangShijun/blob/master/rhyme_study/ranking_function.py) with the YiWeiwen's help

## explanation of the ranking model
- input: a list consist of 4 string, each string representing one line of lyrics
- output: a real number, representing the ranking score
- the ranking score is multiplied by 3 parts (final score = score1 * score2 * score3)
- score1: ranking the rhyme method, such as "排韵", :"交韵", "抱韵", "隔行韵"
- score2: ranking the number of rhyming characters, such as "单押", "双押", "三押"
- score3: ranking the probability of the rhyme, such as "ang", "ong i"
