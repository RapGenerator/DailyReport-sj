## thinking about ideas for front-end development and interaction design, listed as follows:

- generation for whole complete lyrics
	- user gives a keyword or several keywords, we show corresponding complete lyrics **(our original goal)**
	- user gives the first line lyrics, we show corresponding complete lyrics **(easier in some ways)**
	- cool effects and highlights when lyrics are rhyming, like that in 中国新说唱
- lyrics writing helper
	- provides a lyrics-template, fixed number of character, user can choose words to put them in / drag them to template blank. like open completion questions
		- template can be chosen is next step
	- provides words sorted by artistic conception **(i will study that)**
		- it should auto-change based on user's chosen words
	- provides words sorted by and by rhyme **(i will do that)**
		- it should auto-change based on common rhyme words and user's chosen for the last characters for the template
- show information of our team
	- can add so many elements in this part
